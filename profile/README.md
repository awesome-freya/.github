# Awesome Freya

An organization created by the community to host libraries that simplify Freya or add to its functionality.

Current list of libraries:
- [`freya-material`](https://github.com/awesome-freya/freya-material): Material You style components.
- [`freya-transition`](https://github.com/awesome-freya/freya-transition): when `use_animation` is no longer sufficient.
